## 1. Architectural Overview

The game is meant to be structured around **MVC architecture** with additional
patterns. The **MVC** pattern in our architecture consiting of:
- **Model**
  - `GameModel` : The central **GAME** model for our project, implementing the model for our game.
  - `Player`, `Level`, `LevelManager` are also part of it, with entity classes under `entities`
  directory and the level design and management in the `Levels` directory.
- **View**
  - `GameView` : Renders only the game environment, HUD, pause overlay, and transition.
  - `GamePanel`, `GameWindow` : The Swing UI components, and window setup for the game.
  - Main Menu, leaderboard and level-selection are renderers under `main.states`, abstracted with the `GameBaseState` using
    the **State pattern**.
- **Controller**
  - `Game` : The main **Controller** unit and game loop, controlling and composing together the
  **Model** and **View**, along with the different states and observers in the game.
  - `GameBaseState` : An abstract of the concrete states implemented including the `PlayingState`, `MenuState`,
    `LeaderboardState`, `LevelSelectState`. These emulate the **State pattern**, also communicating directly
  with other Objects such as the **Singleton Pattern** of `AudioController`, enriching the system
  with audible haptic feedback and sound.
  - `KeyboardInputs`, `MouseInputs` and `inputs.commands.*` use a **Command pattern**
    for input handling.
  - `events` : Directory includes several **Observer Pattern** Event Listeners, which
  are meant to be implemented to act as interfaces between `Game` and different sub-classes.

### 1.1 High-level component overview

- `MainClass`
  - creates `Game` (main controller)
- `Game`
  - owns `GameModel`, `GameView`, `LevelManager`, `Player`, `AudioController`
  - owns view adapter: `GamePanel`, `GameWindow`
  - manages the current `GameBaseState` implementation
  - acts as the central **Controller** hub, will be listening to low-level model events
    (via listeners on `Player`) and communicating with higher-level
    game events (via `GameEventListener` and `LevelCompletedListener`).
- `GameModel`
  - references `Player`, `LevelManager`
  - exposes getters for data through the view (`GameView`) and controller (`Game`)
- `GameView`
  - reads from `GameModel` and draws via `Graphics`
- `LevelManager`
  - owns the collection of different `Level` objects
  - uses `LoadSave` and `LevelConfigLoader` to build levels from resources
  - exposes `loadNextLevel()` and `resetToFirstLevel()` used by `GameModel` and `Game`.
- `AudioController`
  - singleton that loads and plays music and sound effects (via JavaFX `MediaPlayer`/`AudioClip`)
- `inputs/KeyboardInputs` & `inputs/MouseInputs`
  - map user events to `Command` objects that call into `Game`/`Player`

## 2. Core Class Diagram (Overview) //TODO INSERT UMLS

Here are a few UML-style class diagrams for the core architecture. They are not complete
and have been abstracted to easier understand the key responsibilities and relations in our application software.

Relationships (summary):

- `MainClass` -> `Game` (creates)
- `Game` -> `GameModel`, `GameView`, `LevelManager`, `Player`, `AudioController`, `GamePanel`, `GameWindow`, concrete states

- `GameModel` -> `Player`, `LevelManager`
- `GameView` -> `GameModel`
- `LevelManager` -> [`Level`]s
- `KeyboardInputs` / `MouseInputs` -> `Command` -> `Game` | `Player` | UI (state)

- Work-In-Progress **Observer Pattern**:
- `Game` -> `GameEventListener` for high-level death/level-completion notifications to views/services
- `Game` -> `LevelCompletedListener` (default listener in `Game` that updates the score file via `LoadSave.appendToScoreFile` and forwards to `GameEventListener`)
- `Player` -> `PlayerEventListener` (implemented by `Game`) for death notifications

---

## 3. MVC Responsibilities
Repeating a bit but a more in-depth of why we consider and what we consider for each of the 
Model-View-Controller components. Adding a bit of examples as well.
### 3.1 Model Component

**Key classes:**

- `GameModel`
    - Stores and process most of our game states, the model of the MVC pattern.
    - It handles and communicates with the other classes:
        - Death and respawn detection (`checkIsDead()`, `checkIsRespawn()`).
        - End of a level detection: (`checkIsEndOfLevel()` via `player.hasReachedLevelEnd()`).
        - Level transitions: (`startLevelTransition()`, `updateTransition()`).
        - Pause state and routing of updates.
        - Run statistics used for other classes such as `playerName`, total deaths, total spent time.


- `Player`
    - The `Player` class is meant to encapsulate the movement, physics, collisions (via `HelpMethods`
and current `Level`).
    - Has information for example about `hitbox`, velocities, jump and air state.
    - Uses `isOnLevelEnd(...)` and sets `reachedLevelEnd`. It itself does not
      trigger scoring or transitions directly.
    - Is meant to notify `Game` about deaths through a `PlayerEventListener` instead of
      holding a direct reference to `Game`, everything with **Observer Pattern** at this stage
is however work-in-progress.


- `LevelManager`
    - Builds all levels from images and text resources using `LoadSave` and
      `LevelConfigLoader`.
    - Maintains `currentLevelIndex` and the list of levels `List<Level>`.
    - Uses `update()` that send the information to the current `Level` to update
      platforms, spikes, spawn platform.
    - Exposes `resetToFirstLevel()` used when returning to the main menu.


- `Level`
    - Stores all of the tile data arrays for ground, obstacles and objects.
    - Manages triggers, moving platforms, spikes, and death sprites.

Together these forms the representation of the game world and it's rules.

### 3.2 View Component

**Key classes:**

- `GameView`
    - Responsible for rendering the GUI based on `GameModel`, parsing it downwards to it's respective
  subclasses:
        - Background, tiles, objects (`LevelManager.draw().*`).
        - Curently renders player via the `Player` class: `Player.render(g)`.
        - HUD: current level index and player death count.
        - Pause overlay when `model.isPaused()`.
        - Transition effects using `model.getTransitionScale()`.


- `GamePanel`
    - Swing `JPanel`: sets the size, attaches some of the input listeners, and currently communicates the 
      `paintComponent` to `game.render(g)`.


- `GameWindow`
    - Wraps the Swing `JFrame` creation and focuses on its handling.


- Menu and leaderboard views (`MainMenu`, `Leaderboard`, `LevelSelect`) as different states using State
pattern, switching between these views interchageably.
    - Render their own UIs and rely on `Game` | `LevelManager` | `GameModel` for data.
    - `Leaderboard` reads scores from `LoadSave.readScoreFile()` | `updateScoreFile()` and
      renders per-level the top 5 entries only to not clutter the leaderboards too much.

The view layer is meant to never change any core game rules or state, it is meant to only input the
model or controller and draw this accordingly.

### 3.3 Controller Component

**Key classes:**

- `Game`: the central controller and application **lifecycle** owner.
  - **Responsibilities:**
      - Construct and tie together the full application with model, view, audio, input, and states.
      - Run the main loop (`run()`), calling `update()` and initializing the redrawing of the GUI.
      - Communicate updates to the current `GameBaseState`.
      - Bridge the model events (switching states) to "side effects" such as audio via **AudioController**, 
    initiates the spawn platform reset, and to be querying leaderboard entries by communicating for example level-completed event
            (via `LevelCompletedListener`) instead of calling hard-coded method.
      - Manage the game's different states via the `setGameState(GameState newState)`.
      - React to low-level model callbacks, for example implement `PlayerEventListener` so `Player` can report deaths without
            depending on `Game`.
- **States**
    - `GameBaseState` abstract base: holds reference to `Game` and defines
      `update()`, `render(g)`, `onEnter()`, `onExit()`.
  - `PlayingState`: calls `game.updateGameState()` | `game.renderGame(g)`, and
    is one of the responsibles for switching background music (for the correct state) track using
    `onEnter()`.
  - `MenuState`, `LeaderboardState`, `LevelSelectState`: does similar, switches
    menu/leaderboard/level-select views into the state machine. `MenuState`
    starts menu music using `onEnter()`, similarly to `PlayingState`.
- Inputs & Commands
    - `KeyboardInputs`:
        - On key events, creates or dispatches `Command` objects
          (`MoveLeftPressCommand`, `JumpPressCommand`, `TogglePauseCommand`, etc.).
    - Each `Command` implements an `execute()` that calls into `Game` or
      `Player`, serving as an abstraction layer in-between the component(s).
    - `MouseInputs` also communicates mouse clicks to other UI elements (buttons, level select,
      etc.) via the relevant state, part of this implementation was due to the importance of the haptic
  feedback from our user stories.

## 4. Design Patterns: Summary

### 4.1 MVC

- **Model:** `GameModel`, `Player`, `LevelManager`, `Level`, entities.
- **View:** `GameView`, `GamePanel`, `GameWindow`, menu/leaderboard views.
- **Controller:** `Game`, `GameBaseState` and the derived states, input / command
  classes.

This separation using packages is visible in the directory structures as seen below:

- `main.model` - model-level constructs.
- `main.view` - rendering and Swing adapters.
- `main.states` - states with controllers and their view logic.
- `inputs`, `inputs.commands` - controllers for user input.
- `Game`- once again, the main controller, root of the tree structure like MVC pattern.

The rest is a bit self-explanatory from previous part: **3. MVC Components**

### 4.2 State Pattern
The **State pattern** is used to manage the several different states, in our case the higher level game "modes".
Implemented via the abstract class `GameBaseState` and then inherited via the sub-class concrete states:
`PlayingState`, `MenuState`, `LeaderboardState`, `LevelSelectState`. Using this abstraction we trigger these different
states from other parts of the code.


Each of the **Concrete States** extends `GameBaseState` and overrides `update()` along with
`render(Graphics g)` to implement behavior specific to that **State** or **Mode**. For example,
`PlayingState.update()` calls `game.updateGameState()`, and
`PlayingState.render(g)` calls `game.renderGame(g)`.




`Game` acts as the **Controller** for this, holding a reference to a `GameBaseState` and communicates work to it.
Each concrete state class seperates the logic for one mode
(menu,  gameplay, leaderboard, level select), making it easier to add or
modify modes further in the future.
In the `Game` objects constructor, implemented as current state is the: `private GameBaseState currentState;`
and one instance of each concrete state (`playingState`, `menuState`,`leaderboardState`, `levelSelectState`).

- State transitions are controlled from `Game.setGameState(GameState newState)`:
    - It records the old state, updates its internal `gameState` enum (via Switch Cases), picks the
      correct `currentState` instance based on `newState`, and then calls
      `previousState.onExit()` and `currentState.onEnter()` when called upon.
    - It also currently handles side effects that is related to states (resetting levels when
      returning to menu, starting the run timer when entering PLAYING from
      MENU), but this will be re-evaluated to potentially be implemented via the **Observer Pattern**.
- In the `Game.run()` loop, the game's updates and rendering are communicated to the
  current state, for example:
    - `update()` checks for transitions (`model.isInTransition()`), then calls
      `currentState.update()`.

### 4.3 Command Pattern
`inputs.commands.Command` is a interface completed with the single method of `execute()`. It represents an **action** 
that potentially is triggered by an input.
The input handling code (`KeyboardInputs` / `MouseInputs`) depends only on the `Command` abstraction, 
not on any of the concrete game logic.
Each command encapsulates an action to be performed on the model/controller, 
making it easy to extend (by adding a new command sub-class) without modifying the input listener logic.
- `Game` and `Player` act as **receivers** of these commands, but are unaware of the Command abstraction itself, 
which keeps them seperate (or "decoupled") from the input layer.

- **Keyboard I/O**:
    - `inputs.KeyboardInputs` listens to key events from Swing.
    - It maintains all mappings from any key codes implemented into the `Command` instances for press and release.
    - On `keyPressed` | `keyReleased`, it looks up the correct `Command` and calls `execute()`.
    - Concrete command classes such as `MoveLeftPressCommand`, `MoveLeftReleaseCommand`, 
  `MoveRightPressCommand`, `MoveRightReleaseCommand`, `JumpPressCommand`, `JumpReleaseCommand`, 
  `TogglePauseCommand`, and `GoToMenuCommand` each get parsed their own reference to `Game` through method `execute()`, 
  call into `Game` (and via `Game` into `Player` or `GameModel`).


- **Mouse I/O**:
    - `inputs.MouseInputs` listens to mouse events from Swing.
    - For `mouseMoved` and the object `mousePressed`, it constructs the specific state `Command` 
    - objects based on `game.getGameState()`:
        - In `MENU` state: `MenuMouseMoveCommand`, `MenuMousePressCommand`.
        - In `LEVEL_SELECT` state: `LevelSelectMouseMoveCommand`, `LevelSelectMousePressCommand`.
        - These different commands references the `Game` object and the mouse coordinates, and in `execute()` 
   communictes with the correct view object (for example, `game.mainMenu.mouseMoved(x, y)` or
`game.levelSelect.mousePressed(x, y)`). For example, seen in the GUI, adding haptics to the mouse hoovers
or selection.

### 4.4 Singleton Pattern

`audio.controller.AudioController` implements a **Singleton Pattern**
to provide a single audio object (controller) instance for the entire application. This means, only a single
`AudioController` instance exists, and it is globally accessible via `getInstance()`.
As part of the Design Pattern, the constructor is private, preventing a new instance being created.
The **Singleton Pattern** design gives a better control over the implemented audio resources and avoids
a problem encountered early on in the process, several conflicting JavaFX media (music) initializations.

- It was implemented as a private static field and a **private constructor** that initializes
      JavaFX (`startJavaFX()`) and loads all audio resources (`loadResources()`).


- A public static synchronized method `public static synchronized AudioController getInstance()`
  initially creates the singleton on first call and returns the same instance
  thereafter. The `Synchronization` is necessary to prevent potential thread interference
  when multiple threads access shared data that can be modified, hence also the singleton pattern.
  

- `Game` obtains the audio service by calling `AudioController.getInstance()`
  in its constructor and stores it in `audioController`.


- The other classes that need audio (such as `LevelManager` when wiring
  audio to platforms) go through `Game.getAudioController()` or directly
  through `AudioController.getInstance()`, ensuring there is only one audio
  subsystem.

### 4.5 Observer Pattern
The project uses a lightweight **Observer** pattern in two layers:

1. **Low-level model -> Game callbacks**
    - `PlayerEventListener`:
        - Implemented by `Game`.
        - `Player` holds a `PlayerEventListener` reference and calls `onPlayerDeath()`
          inside `die()`.
        - `Game.onPlayerDeath()` updates the model (`model.onPlayerDeath()`) and
          then notifies higher-level observers via `GameEventListener`.
    - (Optionally) a `LevelChangeListener` can be used in `LevelManager` to
      notify `Game` when `currentLevelIndex` changes, so `Game` can reload the
      player for the new level. This decouples `LevelManager` from calling
      `Game` methods directly.

2. **High-level Game events -> other systems**
    - `GameEventListener`:
        - Interface with callbacks:
            - `onPlayerDeath()`
            - `onLevelCompleted(int levelIndex, int totalDeaths, double timeMs)`
        - `Game` is the **subject** and maintains a list of observers:
            - `private final List<GameEventListener> gameEventListeners = new ArrayList<>();`
            - `addGameEventListener(...)` / `removeGameEventListener(...)` methods.
        - When `Game.onPlayerDeath()` is called (via `PlayerEventListener`), it
          iterates over `gameEventListeners` and calls `onPlayerDeath()` on each.
    - `LevelCompletedListener`:
        - A dedicated listener (or simply a default lambda in `Game`’s constructor)
          is registered to handle level completion.
        - In `Game.updateGameState()`, when `model.checkIsEndOfLevel()` returns
          true, `Game` computes:
            - `timeMs` from `GameModel`'s run timer,
            - `levelIndex` from `LevelManager`,
            - `totalDeaths` from `GameModel`.
        - It then notifies all registered `LevelCompletedListener`s, including a
          default one that:
            - Appends a score line to `leaderboard.txt` via
              `LoadSave.appendToScoreFile(playerName, levelIndex, timeMs, totalDeaths)`.
            - Iterates over `gameEventListeners` and calls
              `onLevelCompleted(levelIndex, totalDeaths, timeMs)` on each.
    - This two-layer approach keeps the model decoupled from the controller
      (via `PlayerEventListener`/`LevelChangeListener`) and the controller
      decoupled from interested views/services (via `GameEventListener` and
      `LevelCompletedListener`).

## 5. Future Improvements

First of all, this document is a "snapshot" of the current design and implementation. Of course
the project has not adhered towards strict purity in **MVC**, as we are still working towards a **Minimum Viable Product**,
but will switch to a more **Finalized End-Product** later.

### 5.1 Central `Game` controller

`Game` has currently a lot of responsibilities (state machine, loop,
construction of objects, some rule based side effects). This could mean that in the future there would be potential 
to abstract it even further, reducing coupling such as isolating the `Leaderboard` logic into a separate
module, such as a "`ScoreServicing`" or "`LeaderboardLogic`" interface.

### 5.2 Observer Pattern
To be very honest, this pattern has been a pain to implement due to our original structure, hence it's
spread out non-coherent state throughout the project.
But we want in the end the different `EventListener`s to be used even more
broadly to decouple UI elements and logic from the core `Game` base.

For example, `LevelManager` currently holds a reference back to `Game` for a few
operations (accesses `Player` or `AudioController` for certain platform
sounds) creating a bidirectional dependency. 

It would also be a smart idea for a `LevelChangeListener` implemented by `Game`, and have
`LevelManager` fire an event instead of calling back into `Game` for
operations such as reloading the player (our current setup). 

Summarized, there's an W.I.P. on this.

### 5.3 Observer Pattern

## 6. Diagrams (Future)

For expanding this into what would be a similar to a **Developers Guide** (as per previous courses)
Diagrams such as:

- **Static View diagram**: We already have the UML, but more abstract
- **Sequence diagram(s)**: For a full level completion flow, I/O, View, etc.
- **Deployment View diagram**: For overview of the architecture (user device to databases and packages).

---

## Conclusion

The current system design according to our group has tried to adhere well to an
**MVC Architecture**, the model which in turn is  supported by the different above mentioned **Design Patterns**.
The responsibilities has been abstracted and tried to be as clear as possible regarding:
- `Model`s encapsulate state(s) and rules.
- `View`s are dedicated to drawing, and to the graphical interface.
- `Controller`s handle coordination, input, events, and state transitions between all the elements.


As written by the instructions and according to us (what we have done so far):

***this SDD should be a solid snapshot 
of our project's current design and good starting point 
for future enhancements and work within this codespace.***
